# Detecting-bots-on-a-social-media-platform-using-ML-algorithms
This proposal aims to investigate the use of machine-learning techniques to detect bots on
social media platforms. The proposed approach analyzes patterns in social media activity
data to distinguish between human users and bots. The objective is to improve the quality
and reliability of information available to social media users and contribute to our
understanding of the role of machine learning in addressing critical issues in contemporary
social media environments.


Detecting bots on a social media platform using ML algorithms in Google Colab involves several stages:

1. Data Preparation: Collect a labeled dataset containing features of both bot and legitimate accounts. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting text to numerical representations (word embeddings), and splitting it into training and testing sets.

2. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset that can help distinguish between bot and legitimate accounts. Features might include user activity patterns, post frequency, account creation date, and more.

3. Algorithm Selection: Choose suitable ML algorithms for bot detection, such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses, making them useful for ensemble methods later.

4. Addressing Imbalance: If the dataset is imbalanced, apply techniques like SMOTE or random under-sampling to balance the number of bot and legitimate samples in the training data.

5. Model Training: Train individual classifiers for each selected algorithm on the training data. Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation to improve performance.

6. Ensemble Learning: Create a hybrid ensemble learning model by combining the predictions from different classifiers. This approach can boost accuracy and reduce overfitting.

7. Jaccard Similarity Test: Use the Jaccard similarity metric to compare similarities between tweet texts of bot accounts. This can further aid in distinguishing bots from legitimate accounts based on the content they share.

8. Final Prediction: Combine the predictions from the ensemble model and the Jaccard similarity test. You can use voting or weighted averaging to arrive at the final prediction.

9. Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test data. This step helps measure how well the model identifies bot accounts.

10. Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to detect bot accounts on the social media platform. Periodically update the model with new data and retrain it to maintain its effectiveness in detecting evolving bot behaviors.

Google Colab provides a convenient environment for implementing this process due to its cloud-based resources, access to powerful GPUs, and integration with popular Python libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, essential for building and evaluating ML models.
